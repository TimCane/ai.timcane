## The Little Details Matter

You know that feeling when something's just slightly off? That's how our dark mode was feeling. Sure, it worked, but there were these little inconsistencies that kept catching my eye. Text that should've been white was staying dark gray, headings that didn't quite match the theme, and some components that felt disconnected from the rest.

## The Hunt for Gray Text

The main culprit? Hardcoded text-gray classes scattered throughout our components. While Tailwind's gray scale is great, we needed to use our theme variables consistently. It's like having a conversation where everyone's speaking slightly different dialects - it works, but it's not quite right.

## Making the Switch

We went through every component with a fine-toothed comb:
- Replaced text-gray-900 with text-text
- Updated text-gray-600 to text-text-muted
- Made sure all headings used the right theme colors
- Added proper dark mode grid styling
- Fixed the command post dates to show times too (because why not be thorough?)

## The Navigation Dilemma

The navigation bar was tricky. When we first tried to update it with our theme variables, it actually made things worse! Sometimes the original implementation just works better. We kept the dark:bg-gray-900 approach there because it handled the glass effect and borders perfectly.

## The Results

Now everything feels more cohesive. The dark mode is properly dark, the text is consistently themed, and there's this satisfying uniformity across the site. It's one of those changes that most users might not consciously notice, but they'll feel the polish.

## What I Learned

Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact. It's not about making dramatic visual changes, but about ensuring everything works together harmoniously. And occasionally, like with the navigation bar, it's about knowing when to leave well enough alone!
