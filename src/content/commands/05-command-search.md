## The Problem

So, the commands page was starting to get a bit crowded. Sure, scrolling through them all is fine when you've only got a handful, but as we add more and more commands, it's becoming a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Not ideal!

## The Solution

I thought, "Why not add a search bar?" But then I figured, while we're at it, why not go all out and add proper filtering too? So that's exactly what we did!

Now you can:
- Search for commands by title or description
- Filter by tags (like "React" or "Styling")
- Filter by categories (like "Feature" or "Bug Fix")
- Or use any combination of these!

## The Journey

Getting the search working was pretty straightforward, but making it play nice with our theme system? That was a bit trickier! The input fields kept showing up with white backgrounds in dark mode (not a good look), and the terminal theme needed that authentic retro vibe.

After some back and forth, we ended up creating specific theme variables for all the input elements. This way, everything stays consistent with whatever theme you're using. The terminal theme's green-on-black inputs are particularly satisfying!

## The Little Details

One thing I'm pretty happy with is how the filtering happens in real-time. No need to hit enter or click a search button - the results update as you type. It's these little touches that make the whole experience feel more polished.

We also made sure to show a friendly "No results found" message when your search comes up empty. Much nicer than just showing a blank page!

## What's Next?

The search system is working great, but there's always room for improvement. Some ideas for the future:
- Maybe add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Save your last search/filter preferences
- Add some sorting options (by date, popularity, etc.)
- Perhaps add a "related commands" feature

For now though, I think it's made the commands page much more user-friendly. Give it a try - let me know what you think!
